I"Ù<p>Presentations matter. They are an opportunity for you to tell your story. Storytelling is like magic to a human mind, and as such your presentation can be too. Itâ€™s easy to end up in a situation where you donâ€™t want to beâ€”especially when youâ€™re knee deep into PowerPointâ€™s design tools. There are many ways to mitigate that situation from happening, but the one thing I use most is simply asking myself <strong>â€œSo what?â€</strong> as much as possible.</p>
