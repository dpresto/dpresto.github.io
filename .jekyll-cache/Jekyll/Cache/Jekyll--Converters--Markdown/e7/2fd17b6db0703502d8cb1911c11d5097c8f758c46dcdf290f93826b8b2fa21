I"B<p>I worked as a bicycle mechanic for years. I studied engineering. Iâ€™ve built, in one way or another, much of the furniture in my apartment. I am familiar with using tools to produce physical items. I consider myself a craftsman in many regards and I understand craftsmanship in the context of physical production.</p>
